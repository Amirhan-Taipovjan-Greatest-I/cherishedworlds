Cherished Worlds is a mod that adds the ability to pin/favorite/bookmark certain worlds. Pinning worlds will force them to always show up at the top of the world selection list and removes the ability to delete them until they are unpinned. Players can pin as many worlds as they want. If there are multiple, pinned worlds will order themselves by last played date like regular worlds.

**This mod is client-side only.**
